Cloth talk. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. Eliptical talk. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. We don’t see them, we will never see them.",
